**UNLP-2025 Shared Task: Detecting Social Media Manipulation**

*Purdue University Fort Wayne, 2025*

Multi-label classification and span-level detection of manipulation techniques in Ukrainian Telegram posts. This work focused on identifying propaganda and manipulation techniques using transformer-based models with explainability and failure-mode analysis.

## Task Description

- **Multi-label Classification**: Identify multiple manipulation techniques present in social media posts
- **Span Detection**: Locate specific text spans where manipulation occurs
- **Context**: Ukrainian Telegram posts in high-stakes disinformation environment

## Approach

- RoBERTa-based models with rationale-guided training
- Emphasis on explainability and interpretable predictions
- Systematic failure-mode analysis to understand model limitations
- Cross-lingual transfer learning techniques

## Key Findings

- Achieved competitive performance on manipulation technique classification
- Identified systematic challenges in span-level detection for code-mixed text
- Demonstrated importance of explainability in high-stakes NLP applications

## Skills & Tools

Python, Transformers, RoBERTa, XLM-R, Multi-label Classification, Span Detection, Explainable AI
