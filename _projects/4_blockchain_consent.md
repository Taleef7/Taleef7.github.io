**Patient Consent Management via Smart Contracts**

_LUMS Final Year Project_

Designed and extended a patient-consent prototype using blockchain smart contracts with fine-grained access control. The system focuses on auditability, secure consent updates, and realistic healthcare workflow integration.

## Objectives

- Provide patients with granular control over medical data access
- Create immutable audit trail of all consent changes
- Enable secure, transparent consent management in healthcare settings
- Support dynamic consent updates while maintaining security

## Technical Implementation

- Smart contract architecture for consent management
- Fine-grained access control mechanisms
- Role-based permissions for healthcare providers
- Audit logging and transparency features
- Integration considerations for clinical workflows

## Key Features

- **Granular Control**: Patients can specify exactly which data types each provider can access
- **Auditability**: Complete history of who accessed what data and when
- **Dynamic Updates**: Patients can revoke or modify consent at any time
- **Secure Updates**: Cryptographic verification of consent changes
- **Workflow Integration**: Designed to fit realistic healthcare provider workflows
